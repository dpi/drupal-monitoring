- Wondering if we should add a SensorInfo::getSensor() (factory to create a sensor based on getSensorClass()), to a) solve the type hint problem and b), support container service injection like plugins with the create() method. See ContainerFactory, you would just inline that logic. Advantage: Easier to convert to plugins later.
- the status message in SensorCronLastRunAge is now almost duplicated due to the value type formatting, but that's an existing problem in 7.x.
- SensorImageMissingStyle => should use entity api to load the file, also https://drupal.org/node/1812240 (file_usage() no longer exists, Drupal::service('file.usage') instead. Please update the change record :) => The only interesting verbose output that we have and we have no test coverage? sad panda :)
